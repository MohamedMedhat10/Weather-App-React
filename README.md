## Project Overview

Welcome to my React Weather App project! This application allows users to input a city name and instantly fetches real-time weather data and displays the location on a map. It leverages React.js for the front-end interface and integrates with weather APIs to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

## Features

- **Weather Information**: Displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the specified city.
- **Location Map**: Shows the geographical location of the city on an interactive map.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design, making it easy for users to quickly access weather details.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes weather APIs to fetch weather data.
- **Maps Integration**: Integrates with mapping services to display the location.

## How to Use

1. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for.
2. Click on the search or submit button to fetch and display weather information.
3. View the current weather conditions and location on the map.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Forecast**: Implement a feature to display the extended weather forecast.
- **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize units (metric/imperial) for weather data.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
